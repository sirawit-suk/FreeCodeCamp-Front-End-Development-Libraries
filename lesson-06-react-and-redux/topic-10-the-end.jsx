  for my opinion, we can use all context api instead.
  and it's easier than redux state managements.

  however, maybe if we need to use redux.
  try redux toolkit because it is easier than redux itself.

  the redux strength point (my pov) will be the debug mode that light debug from time to time.
  and... maybe have something that I haven't see it yet.
